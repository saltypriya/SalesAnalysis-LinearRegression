# SalesAnalysis-LinearRegression

Project Description: 
This project addresses the issues of a new grocery shop facing a sales decline. Our objective is to construct a smart model that predicts future sales patterns and pinpoints important elements influencing sales by using advanced analytics on historical sales. We seek to give clear insights for the retailer to efficiently simplify operations.
We'll sift through historical data to uncover trends and insights into customer behavior, product preferences, and external influences. The result will be a simple sales forecast model and actionable recommendations for enhancing day-to-day operations. Our goal is to provide the shop with simple tools for navigating problems, increasing sales, and ensuring long-term profitability in the competitive supermarket industry.
